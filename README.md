Charges And Fields with Electric Field Lines
=============
"Charges And Fields" is an educational simulation in HTML5, that is forked from  <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">PhET Interactive Simulations</a>
at the University of Colorado Boulder.

This forked version supports electric field lines. Electric field lines are displayed when double tapping/clicking on an electric field sensor.

### Documentation
The <a href="http://bit.ly/phet-development-overview" target="_blank">PhET Development Overview</a> is the most complete guide to PhET Simulation
Development. This guide includes how to obtain simulation code and its dependencies, notes about architecture & design, how to test and build
the sims, as well as other important information.
